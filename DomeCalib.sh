# Goal: Camera calibration using multiple scenes (multiple visualSfM files)
# Assume that all the scenes (captured by static cameras) are located in "path" folder
# e.g., $path/xx, $path/yy, $path/zz and so on. The folder names xx, yy are not important.
# (But note that you should not use $path/full folder, since it is used for the final output)
#
# This script runs the following
# 1. Run visualSfM in each folder by generating "nvm" files
# 2. Generate a consolidated scene (containing all the 3D points from all scenes) by the generating a unified matching file and SIFT files. 
#    As output, $path/full folder has been generated
# 2.5 Copy jpg files to $path/full. This images are dummy files, and are only required to run visualSfM, (The scene can be arbitrary, but should have images from all sensors)
# 3. Run visualSfM on $path/full. 
#    As output, $path/full/result.nvm has been generated. The output contains all 3D points from all scenes.  You can check the result by loading in VisualSfM.
# 4. Run Bundle Adjustment from  $path/full/result.nvm. 
#    As output, $path/full/output folder has been generated, where all the final outputs are located. 
#    You can visualize the final calibration output by loading $path/full/output/BA_caliball.nvm in VisualSfM. 
#    For the details on the calibration output in $path/full/output, see Gaku's original documentation:
#    https://github.com/CMU-Panoptic-Studio/ProjectorBasedCalibration/blob/master/docs/DomeCalibration.pdf
# 5. Compute mk2nvm whicih is a 4x4 matrix from multiple kinect space (define wrt the depth cam of kinectNode1) to nvm's coord.
#	 Ignored, if kinectCalibPath is not valid. 

# Note: This script doesn't care the number of scenes (subfolders) in $path file. 
# You may put many scenes by capturing with changing projected patterns  or our "white tent" location
# Note 2: Each scene can have images from any sensors (VGA, HD, Kinect color). VisualSfM doesn't care it. 

# Naming rules
# 00_00 - 00_31 mean  HD cameras
# 01_01 - 20_24 mean VGA cameras
# 50_1 - 50_10 mean Kinect color cameras
